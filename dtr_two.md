# DTR Checkin Mid Project

## Things going well
- Teamwork + collaboration
- Communication
- Figuring out projects without much of a roadmap
- When we "disagree" on format or different ways to solve a problem -> we do a good job discussing both options and picking the one that works best. Might even try both and go with one.
- Learning from each other
- Learning to be better programmers
- We're in a good spot on our project. Yay!
- Know where we're going / how to move forward
- Checking in with each other on how we are, how's the project going
- Giving good feedback when it arises



## Things we can do better
- Implement testing rather than running pry
- More TDD rather than DDD
- Post more in our slack channel

## Weekend scheduling checkin
- Knock out some stuff tonight (Friday), hard cut off 10pm
- Matt out from 9 - 2pm on Saturday
- Kim out 3:15 - 11pm on Saturday
- Setup things we can work on when we're not together - talk about on Friday evening
- Get together at 2/2:30
- Get together on Sunday

## Goals for Sunday evening
- Working game, getting back to where we we're before the regroup (thanks Megan lol)
- Feel good on Sunday after having some "me" time on Saturday
- Having some tests for turn class
- More coverage!
