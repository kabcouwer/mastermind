# DTR

## Learning goals
- teamwork + collaboration
- figuring out projects without much of a roadmap
- psuedocoding
- setting structure / deciding how to split the project into sections
- implement testing rather than running pry

## What drives us
-get more comfortable manipulating different parts to code / changing code to try new things
-want to learn more concepts
-get more practice
-passing this project to relieve some stress about graduating the mod
-learning hashes
-learning from each other and getting some hot tips on whats working well and whats not

## Collaboration Style
- Matt
- equal decision making
- equal input
- agreement
- pair programming is best -Dragon Alligator

- Kim
- equal decision making
- equal input
- agreement
- pair programming is best -Dragon Alligator

## Communication - how do we communicate best
- Kim
- appreciate open and honest
- slack / zoom calls
- checkins to make sure we're on the same page and if we need to make any changes
- positive
- laid back
- willingness to learn how to be better collaborators / open to critical feedback

- Matt
- giving and receiving feedback (positive and critical)
- being positive
- laid back
- slack / tuple maybe an option since zoom kicks us off
- chickins sound good and are important
- willingness to learn how to be better collaborators / open to critical feedback

## Describe your work style
- Kim
- Quiet spaces work well
- Putting on pants not sweats
- Listen to music sometimes
- Implementing POM breaks
- Being able to step away when I'm stuck on something
- Work in the morning before class (preteach too) because my minds fresher
- AND work after class til 9/10 with a walk/run from 4-4:30 (not requirement)
- Making sure I'm getting enough hours of sleep
- I have a hard time going to bed on code with bugs - working on it!
- flexible

- Matt
- Quiet spaces work well
- Study hall / working with others has been helping take more breaks
- Preteach in the mornings
- Project work in the afternoon/evenings
til about 9/10
- flexible

## Strengths
- Kim
- empathy
- if I do something, I do it well
- communicating my needs and boundaries
- feel like I'm in the middle of the class in a technical sense with my engineering undergrad
- good at problem solving

- Matt
- strong attention to detail
- very persistent
- go above and beyond on tasks / do good work
- resourceful

## Strengths and how they compliment each other
- do good work
- Kims problem solving and Matts attention to detail will work well together

## What's going well
-cohort is awesome and super supportive and helpful
-cohort is outgoing
-doing well following along with the lessons / actually doing the code along
-Rocked the IC and passed first project
-80-90% understanding of concepts so far especially after helping others out
-talking through problems with others in a strategic way
-not feeling overwhelmed YET
-filling time efficiently


## What's not going well
-not taking enough POM breaks
-Kim needs to do better about taking walks/moving my body
-research mastermind beforehand and fully grasp how the game works (created problems with war and peace)
-need to implement more preteaching because projects involve concepts we haven't learned yet

## Setting Direction and making decisions as a team
-communication
-setting small goals + bigger goals
- debriefs / checkins after goals are met
-setting large goals
-celebrating wins
-staying positive

## How will we overcome obstacles
-understanding the obstacle and when it arises
- pointing it out when it happens
- taking a step back and talking through it together
- making a plan
- using those resources
-working together
-driver/navigator
-being kind to each other
-setting those small goals
-being resourceful
-knowing/figuring out when to reach out for help

## Scheduling restraints
-Kim
- work at brewery from 4pm - 10pm on Saturday
- fully vaxd AND both local

-Matt
- also fully vaxd and local so we could meet up irl! If we want
- 10am to 1pm Saturday sisters birthday

## feedback
- if critical it will be constructive
- both have a willingness to give and receive feedback
- sometimes say a positive thing and say critical thing
- both pretty chill this is gonna be great and learn a lot!

## Biggest technical strengths
-Kim
- problem solving
- persistence

-Matt
- resourcefulness
- persistence

## Improvement in technical skills
-Kim
- spend some personal time going through hashes + class and objects + iteration ruby exercises
- making time for preteaching

-Matt
- figuring out a starting point for this project and piecing it together
- practice learned concepts + new ones too

## How we can help each other improve
- being each others resource is we need help this week
- seeing how these goals for ourselves are going
- celebrating those wins

## Tools
-simplecov
-trello board?

## How are we gonna solve bugs
-collaborative work
-driver/navigator
-be resourceful
-use google
-not be afraid to change up our code to test out different ways of doing stuff
-improve on our technical skills alongside of this project

## How do you know the project is successful?
-grading rubric
-print out the screen and have a running game
-be able to quit the game
-being proud of our work
-maybe getting to those extensions
-at the end of the day we've learned a lot and added to our technical skills

## How will we celebrate our wins
-pointing them out
-stepping away from the code and allowing ourselves to feel good about what I just did
- big fan putting on a song and dancing it out
- sometimes grab a beer or a snack or a flavored bubbly water
-move over tasks on trello
